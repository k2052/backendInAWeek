      <p>Your backend will be in Ruby. It will be powered by <a href="http://intridea.github.io/grape/">Grape</a> a 
      minimalist web framework with a powerful DSL for expressing APIs. 
      Tests will be written using <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a>. Test fixtures will be created using 
      <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a>. Any external API calls will be mocked using 
      <a href="https://github.com/bblimke/webmock">WebMock</a> and or cached using <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr">VCR</a>. </p>
      
      <p>If background jobs are needed they will be written as 
      <a href="https://github.com/karmajunkie/imperator">Imperator</a> commands and then run with either 
      <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>. 
      JSON responses will be done using <a href="https://github.com/ismasan/oat">Oat</a>. You will have your choice of a 
      data store and ORM; MongoMapper, ToyStore, Mongoid, DataMapper or NoBrainer. </p>
      
      <p>Your API will conform to <a href="http://jsonapi.org">json:api</a>. It will be designed to be consumed as easily 
      from the web as from mobile. It will be discoverable (think HATEOAS) and data will be as denormalized 
      as possible. It will use tokens for authentication not cookies. 
      It will be documented with <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> and tested 
      using <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd">Dredd</a>.</p>
      
      <p>I believe in separation of concerns, slim models and clean controllers. You wont find your backend 
      polluted with logic in places where it doesn't belong. What you will find is a lot of interactors, 
      value objects, commands, policies, and decorators. 
      I believe in a readable codebase; if dogma gets in the way of that I throw it out quickly and go with 
      what is more readable. 
      I don't use a pattern when the codebase is cleaner without it. Patterns are just tools.</p>

        <h2>
          API Blueprint
        </h2>
        <p>The process starts by documenting the API with an <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>.
        Ideally, you will have already written this and provide it to me.
        For an extra fee I will write them for you.</p>
        
        <p>Why do I start with API docs?</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>It provides a guide mark for completion. How much of the API is passing is a good indicator of how 
        much progress has been made. If something from the API spec is not built yet 
        then the backend is not done. The project is not considered complete (no matter how much else is done) until the API is fully covered by tests and those tests are passing.</li>
          <li>You can build your app independently of its backend and then when its ready swap out the mocks for 
        the real thing.</li>
          <li>It serves to scope the project and clearly lay out what we are agreeing on. </li>
          <li>Helps future developers and you know how everything works. Forgotten how a part of your backend 
        works? Need to get a developer up to speed? Just consult the documentation.</li>

          Quote and Timeline
        </h2>
        <p>I will review your api docs, ask any questions I might have, then give you an estimated start 
        time and cost. I tackle only one freelance project at a time so you can count on my full attention 
        from start to finish.</p>

        <h2>
          50% Upfront
        </h2>
        <p>Once I'm ready to start I'll ask you for 50% upfront and then I'll begin working as soon as payment 
        is received. I accept payment via Google Wallet, Simple Instant, Square Cash, and Bitcoin; and only 
        if absolutely necessary, Paypal.</p>

        <p>I believe in the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a>. I start out 
        by creating an app skeleton that works and is easily; deployed, tested, monitored 
        and analyzed. First; I setup a Github repo, a deploy/build script, a foreman env file, Travis CI 
        scripts, rake tasks for running tests etc. I add Travis CI, Gemnasium, Coveralls and Code Climate to 
        every project. I don't start coding until the README is full of green badges.</p>

      <div class="section rapid-commits">
        <h2>
          Hourly Commits
        </h2>
        <p>I believe in semantic versioning, test driven development, an always working master branch and 
        breaking things as soon as possible. You'll be able to glance at the commit log and see actual 
        progress hourly. At any time you'll be able to checkout the master branch and have it work; checkout 
        the broken branch and see bugs being worked on etc. 
        No wondering what is happening, waiting on emails, or feeling anxious about checking in, 
        you only need to look at the repo and you will know what the status is.</p>

          Delivery, Review and Final Payment

        <p>When Dredd is fully passing, all the rspecs fly, and all the badges are green, I will send you an 
        email asking for review. Once you have reviewed things and we both agree things are done, then the 
        final 50% is paid and we hi-five!</p>

      <p>You'll receive an app with a Procfile, build/deploy script (dokku) and an example .env file. All you'll 
      have to do is setup your env file, run the build scripts, and then it's as easy as git push. The app 
      will be tested with both Heroku and Dokku (on DigitalOcean).</p>
